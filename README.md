 # MATLAB scripts for time series forecasting:
 
In these 2 scripts , We have the application of the Discrete Wavelet Transform in conjunction with 
machine learning algorithms, such as Neural Networks (MLP) and Support Vector Regression to short-time forecasting of a time series.

The Discrete Wavelet Transform extract the high (details) and low (approximation) frequencies of a signal (our signal is the time series).
This is very helpful, because We can use these new features (frequencies components) as input to the machine learning algorithms.
